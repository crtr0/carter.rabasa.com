You know that new-car smell a computer has when it's just been unboxed and you're booting it up for the first time?  That smell always make me think: *it's time to set-up development environments!*

Here's a simple script I put together to install [Ruby on Rails][] on Mac OS X Lion based on instructions that Alain Beauvois [posted][] to Stack Overflow. It requires that you've already installed [Xcode][]. Hope you find this helpful!
