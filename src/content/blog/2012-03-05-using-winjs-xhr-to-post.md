In the process of building a [Windows 8][] [Twilio][] app, I ran head first into an issue using [WinJS.xhr][] to send POST requests. The official documentation is pretty thin, so I thought I'd write-up how to accomplish this here.

Using WinJS.xhr in general is quite nice. It abstracts away all the nonesense of [XMLHttpRequest][] and provides a simple interface that uses [Promises][] to handle the asynchronous responses. Here's a simple example that uses the Twilio REST API to retrieve a list of SMS messages from a user's account:

    WinJS.xhr({
      user: accountSid, password: authKey,
      url: "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/" + accountSid + "/SMS/Messages.json"
    }).then(
      function (success) {
        console.log(JSON.parse(success.responseText));
      },
      function (error) {
        console.log(JSON.parse(error.responseText));
      }
    );

Obviously, the example would be much shorter if I wasn't using HTTP BASIC auth and had defined some named functions for the callback. But hey, pretty simple! Anyway, what if you want to do a POST? We'll here's what _won't_ work:

    WinJS.xhr({
      type: "post", user: accountSid, password: authKey,
      url: "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/" + accountSid + "/Calls.json",
      data: dataString
    }).then(success, error);

You'll notice I defined `type: "post"` to indicate that I want to POST. But, it turns out this is not enough. The answer to getting this to work is to manually set the response header. Here's some code that _does_ work:

    WinJS.xhr({
      type: "post", user: accountSid, password: authKey,
      url: "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/" + accountSid + "/Calls.json",
      headers: { "Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
      data: dataStr
        }).then(success, error);

That's it. Just make sure to set:

    headers: { "Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" }

..and you're good to go!
