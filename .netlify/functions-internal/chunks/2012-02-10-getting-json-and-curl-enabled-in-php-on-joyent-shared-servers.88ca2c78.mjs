const body = "\nAfter starting at Twilio, I wanted to get a bunch of development environments set up where it would be easy to hack around with the API and put together demos quickly. One of my hosts is [Joyent][], whom I love. I've been using them since they were TextDrive and have never had any problems that weren't self-inflicted. I have about a dozen domains set-up on their shared hosting service and got to work downloading the [Twilio PHP helper library][] and creating a simple app to use Twilio's [REST API][] to send a text message.\n\nThis is the point at which my productivity came to a screeching halt and I confronted the dreaded [white screen of death][]. PHP was (silently) telling me that something was wrong. In order to get back on track, I needed to configure PHP to show the errors it was encountering. Luckily, this was pretty simple. I just logged-in to my host and tracked down the PHP initialization file for the domain I was working with.\n\n    [platt:~] crabasa$ cd domains/rabasa.com\n    [platt:~/domains/rabasa.com] crabasa$ vi etc/php5/php.ini\n\nThen I looked for the property that control the display of errors and made sure it was set to \"On\":\n\n    display_errors = On\n\nAwesome, now it's time to hit \"reload\" and see what's going on. PHP is quick to tell me:\n\n    Fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init() in /users/home/crabasa/software/twilio-php/Services/Twilio/TinyHttp.php on line 61\n\nIt seems that the PHP helper library has dependencies, in this case cURL. The [cURL module][] is neccessary to make the HTTP calls to the Twilio REST API. This is an easy fix, I just need to edit my php.ini and un-comment the line that includes the cURL extension:\n\n    extension=curl.so\n\nWoo hoo! I'm home free, right? Wrong:\n\n    Fatal error: Call to undefined function json_decode() in /users/home/crabasa/software/twilio-php/Services/Twilio.php on line 148\n\nLooks like there's another dependency, this time on JSON. The [JSON module][] allows us to deserialize the JSON data we get back from the API. Let's include the JSON extension as well:\n\n    extension=json.so\n\nThat's it! With a couple of tweaks I am now ready to start hitting web service APIs using PHP.
